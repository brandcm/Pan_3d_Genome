# *Pan* 3d Genome

This repository houses data and scripts used in the *Pan* 3d Genome project.

- The data directory contains many of the data used in the analysis. Due to space constraints, some of the larger files (e.g., FASTAs and VCFs), are not included here but the means to retrieve or generate such files is described in the directory README.md. 

- The scripts directory contains most the scripts used in the analysis for data generation, analysis, and visualization. The remaining scripts are housed in the data directory.
