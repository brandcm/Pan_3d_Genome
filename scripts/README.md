This directory contains subdirectories that house most of the scripts used for this project. Subdirectories are briefly described below.

- 1_generate_FASTAs contains scripts that generate pseudo-haploid sequences per individual from filtered genotypes.

- 2_generate_3d_maps_and_comparisons contains scripts that predict chromatin contact genome-wide for each individual and generate pairwise comparisons.

- 3_in_silico_mutagenesis contains scripts that use *in silico* mutagenesis on variants of interest to identify individual SNVs that underlie large differences in chromatin contact between sets of individuals.

- annotations contains scripts that download and format relevant genomic annotations for analysis and visualization.

- notebooks contains notebooks used in data compilation, analysis, and visualization.

- other_scripts contains scripts that generate various data to aid in analysis.
