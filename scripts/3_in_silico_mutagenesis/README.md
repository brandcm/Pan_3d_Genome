This directory contains subdirectories and files used to conduct *in silico* mutagenesis of multiple variant sets.

- the basenji subdirectory contains scripts to run Akita.

- in_silico_mutagenesis_noteboook.ipynb is a notebook that can complete and visualize *in silico* mutagenesis of an individual variant step by step.

- the ppn_specific_variants subdirectory contains scripts to complete *in silico* mutagenesis of bonobo-specific variants in bonobo-chimpanzee divergent windows.

- the ptr_subspecies_specific_variants subdirectory contains scripts to complete *in silico* mutagenesis of chimpanzee subspecies-specific variants.

- the scripts subdirectory contains the core scripts used in this set of analyses.
